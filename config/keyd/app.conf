# what it achieves: if pressed once, send just ctrl+a. If pressed second time,

# how it works: sends C-a and activates layer navhome for one next key press

# telegram specific
## select message to reply
control.p = C-up
control.n = C-down
## edit last message
control.l = up

# hack: I did rebind ctrl+f, so make other shortcut for calling search
control.g = C-f
